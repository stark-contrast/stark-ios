The Stark Lab Service, including the recommendations made therein, cannot be regarded as, nor does it substitute, any legal advice given by a professional or expert and Customer should consult with their own legal counsel as necessary.

3.4 - Beta Releases and Free Access Subscriptions. Stark Lab may provide Customer with a Stark Lab Service for free or on a trial basis (a “Free Access Subscriptions”) or with “alpha”, “beta”, or other early-stage Stark Lab Services, integrations, or features (“Beta Releases”), which are optional for Customer to use. Stark Lab makes no promises that future versions of Beta Releases or Free Access Subscriptions will be released or will be made available under the same commercial or other terms. Stark Lab may terminate Customer’s right to use any Free Access Subscriptions or Beta Releases at any time in Stark Lab’s sole discretion, without liability. WITH RESPECT TO BETA RELEASES, CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT BETA RELEASES MAY NOT BE COMPLETE OR FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS FOR WHICH STARK LAB WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE. ACCORDINGLY, ANY USE OF BETA RELEASES ARE AT CUSTOMER’S SOLE RISK NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN.

4. Customer Data
4.1 - Rights in Customer Data. As between the parties, Customer retains all right, title, and interest (including any intellectual property rights) in and to the Customer Data. Customer grants Stark Lab a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right to collect, use, modify and process Customer Data solely: (i) to provide the Stark Lab Service and related services to Customer and (ii) to generate separate anonymous data sets about product usage that do not identify Customer or its employees and that are stripped of all persistent identifiers (such as name, email address, etc.) (“Aggregate/Anonymous Data”).

4.2 - Security. Stark Lab will implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect Customer Data in the Stark Lab Service against unauthorized or unlawful processing, accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss or alteration, and unauthorized disclosure or access.

5. Fees and Payment
5.1 - Fees. To the extent the Stark Lab Services are made available for a fee, Customer agrees to pay all fees in United States Dollars. Stark Lab’s fees are exclusive of all taxes, and Customer must pay any applicable sales, use, VAT, GST, excise, withholding, or similar taxes or levies, whether domestic or foreign, other than taxes based on the income of Stark Lab. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, payments are non-refundable and non-creditable and payment obligations non-cancellable.

5.2 - Credit Card Payment Terms. If Customer has signed up to pay via credit card, Customer shall provide its payment information to Stark Lab or to one of its payment processors. Customer represents to Stark Lab that is the authorized user of the card, PIN, key or account associated with that payment instrument, and Customer authorizes Stark Lab to charge its credit card or other payment instrument for any funds or other fees (including transaction and credit card fees) incurred by you in connection with the Stark Lab Services. In addition, Customer is solely responsible for either (a) enabling auto-recharge on Customer’s payment instrument or (b) ensuring that Customer’s payment instrument has a sufficient positive balance to cover all fees due. If, for any reason, Customer has a negative balance on its account(s), then Stark Lab reserves the right to suspend access to the Stark Lab Services.

5.3 - Invoicing Payment Terms. If the corresponding Order Form specifies that Customer is to pay via invoice, Stark Lab shall invoice Customer in accordance with the payment terms set forth in the Order Form. Except as otherwise set forth in an Order Form, Customer will make all of the undisputed fees hereunder within seven (7) days of the date of the invoice. If Customer is overdue on any payment of undisputed fees and fails to pay within ten (10) business days of a written notice, then Stark Lab may assess, and Customer agrees to pay a late fee of either 1.5% per month, or the maximum amount allowable by applicable law, whichever is less.

5.4 - Disputes. Customer must notify Stark Lab in writing of any good-faith invoice dispute within twenty (20) days of the applicable invoice date and reasonably cooperate with Stark Lab in resolving any dispute. If the parties are unable to resolve a dispute within ten (10) days of Customer’s notice, each party will have the right to seek any remedies it may have under this Agreement, at law or in equity, irrespective of any provision in this Agreement that would limit seeking these remedies on account of a payment dispute. For clarity, any undisputed amounts must be paid in full in accordance with this Section.

6. Term and Termination
6.1 - Term. This Agreement is effective as of the Effective Date and continues until terminated. Either party may terminate this Agreement with thirty (30) days’ advance written notice if all Terms for the Stark Lab Service(s) have expired or are terminated as expressly permitted in this Agreement.

6.2 - Renewals. By executing an Order Form for purchase of a Stark Lab Service, Customer is agreeing to pay applicable fees for the entire Term. Customer cannot cancel or terminate this Agreement except as expressly permitted by Section 6.4 (Termination for Cause) and Section 10.1 (Limited Warranty). If no start date is specified on the applicable Order Form, the Term starts when Customer first obtains access to the Stark Lab Service. Each Term will automatically renew for additional successive renewal terms with the same length as the initial term unless: (i) otherwise stated on the applicable Order Form; or (ii) either party gives written notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days before the end of the then-current Term.

6.3 - Suspension of Service. Stark Lab may suspend Customer’s access to the Stark Lab Service(s) if Customer’s account is overdue and Customer fails to pay amounts due within ten (10) days of notice by Stark Lab, subject to Section 5.4 (Disputes). Stark Lab may also suspend Customer’s access to the Stark Lab Service(s) if it determines that suspension is necessary to prevent harm or liability to other customers or third parties, or to preserve the security, stability, availability or integrity of the Stark Lab Service.

6.4 - Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement, including any related Order Form, if the other party: (i) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay undisputed fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice detailing the breach; (ii) ceases operation without a successor; or (iii) if permitted by applicable law, seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any of these proceedings are instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter).

6.5 - Effect of Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement or an Order Form, Customer’s license rights terminate and it must promptly: (a) stop using the applicable Stark Lab Service(s) (including any related Stark Lab Technology); (b) delete (or, at Stark Lab’s request, return) any and all copies of the Stark Lab Code, any Stark Lab documentation, passwords or access codes, and any other Stark Lab Confidential Information in Customer’s possession, custody, or control. If Stark Lab terminates this Agreement for cause as provided in Section 6.4 (Termination for Cause), any payments for the remaining portion of the Term will become due and must be paid immediately by Customer. If Customer terminates this Agreement for cause as provided in Section 6.4 (Termination for Cause), Customer will receive a refund of any fees it has pre-paid for the terminated portion of the applicable Term. Except where this Agreement specifies an exclusive remedy, all remedies under this Agreement, including termination or suspension, are cumulative and not exclusive of any other rights or remedies that may be available to a party.

6.6 - Survival. The following Sections survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 1 (Definitions); 2 (Account Registration and Use); 3.2 (General Restrictions); 3.3 (Beta Releases and Free Access Subscriptions); 4.1 (Rights in Customer Data); 5 (Fees and Payment); 6 (Term and Termination); 7 (Confidential Information); 8 (Stark Lab Technology); 9 (Indemnification); 10 (Disclaimers); 11 (Limitations of Liability); and 12 (General).

7. Confidential Information
7.1 - Confidentiality Obligation. Each party (as the receiving party) must: (i) hold in confidence and not disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to third parties except as permitted by this Agreement; and (ii) only use the other party’s Confidential Information to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this Agreement. Each party may share the other party’s Confidential Information with its employees, agents or contractors having a legitimate need to know (which, for Stark Lab, includes the subcontractors referenced in Section 12.4), provided that the party remains responsible for any recipient’s compliance with the terms of this Section 7 and that these recipients are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective than this Section.

7.2 - Exclusions. These confidentiality obligations do not apply to (and Confidential Information does not include) information that: (i) is or becomes public knowledge through no fault of the receiving party; (ii) was known by the receiving party before it received the Confidential Information; (iii) is rightfully obtained by the receiving party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (iv) is independently developed by the receiving party without using the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. A party may also disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to the extent required by law or court order, provided it gives advanced notice (if permitted by law) and cooperates in any effort by the other party to obtain confidential treatment for the information.

7.3 - Remedies. The parties acknowledge that disclosing Confidential Information may cause substantial harm for which damages alone may be an insufficient remedy, and so on breach of this Section, each party is entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to any other remedies it may have at law.

8. Stark Lab Technology
8.1 - Ownership and Updates. This is a term-limited agreement for access to and use of the Stark Lab Service. Customer acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited right to use the Stark Lab Service and no ownership rights are transferred to Customer under this Agreement. Stark Lab (or its suppliers) retain all rights, title and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to all Stark Lab Technology, which is deemed Stark Lab’s Confidential Information, and reserves any licenses not specifically granted in this Agreement. Other than the Stark Lab Code, the Stark Lab Service is offered as an online, hosted product. Accordingly, Customer acknowledges and agrees that it has no right to obtain a copy of the software behind any Stark Lab Service. In addition, Stark Lab may collect learnings, logs, and data regarding the performance and use of the Stark Lab Service, and that Stark Lab may make updates, bug fixes, modifications or improvements to the Stark Lab Service from time-to-time.

8.2 - Feedback. If Customer elects to provide any suggestions, comments, improvements, information, ideas or other feedback or related materials to Stark Lab (collectively, “Feedback”), Customer hereby grants Stark Lab a worldwide, perpetual, non-revocable, sublicensable, royalty-free right and license to use, copy, disclose, license, distribute, and exploit any Feedback in any format and in any manner without any obligation, payment, or restriction based on intellectual property rights or otherwise, however Stark Lab will not identify Customer as the source of the Feedback. Nothing in this Agreement limits Stark Lab’s right to independently use, develop, evaluate, or market products, whether incorporating Feedback or otherwise.

9. Indemnification
Customer agrees to defend Stark Lab from and against any third-party claim to the extent resulting from any Customer Properties, its negligence, willful misconduct or breach of this Agreement. Customer will indemnify and hold Stark Lab harmless from and against any damages and costs awarded against Stark Lab or agreed in settlement by Customer (including reasonable attorney’s fees) that result from these third-party claims. Customer must not settle any claim without Stark Lab’s prior written consent if the settlement would require Stark Lab to admit fault, pay amounts that Customer must pay under this Agreement, or take or refrain from taking any action. Stark Lab may participate in a claim through counsel of its own choosing at its own expense and Customer and Stark Lab will reasonably cooperate on the defense.

10. Disclaimers
ALL STARK LAB TECHNOLOGY AND RELATED SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. NEITHER STARK LAB NOR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKE ANY OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.
